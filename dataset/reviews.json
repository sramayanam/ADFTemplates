The interior craftsmanship was outstanding, with high-quality materials used throughout, and the seats were comfortable even on long drives. The fuel efficiency was impressive for a car of its size, but its performance did not disappoint either. The infotainment system was a bit complex, but manageable after some practice. Overall, a fantastic vehicle for those who appreciate both comfort and performance.  ",
